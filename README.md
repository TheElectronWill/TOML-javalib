# TOML-javalib
This is a little and simple [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) library.
Its goal is to allow Java developers to easily use the TOML format in their applications.
This library is compatible with TOML v0.4.0.

## How to use
The main class is Toml.java. It contains public static methods for reading and writing TOML data.  
You can read data like this:
```java
//import com.electronwill.toml.Toml;
File file = new File("myFile.toml");
Map<String, Object> data = Toml.read(file);
```

And write data like this:
```java
//import com.electronwill.toml.Toml;
File file = new File("myFile.toml");
Map<String, Object> data = ...//put your data in a Map
Toml.write(data, file);
```

You may also use the TomlReader and TomlWriter classes directly.  
**Warning:** the TomlReader does not support the "\r\n" sequence, nor the '\r' character. New lines must be indicated by the '\n' character.
